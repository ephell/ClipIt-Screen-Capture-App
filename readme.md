ClipIt is a user-friendly application aimed at simplifying the creation of short video clips. It initiates recording when an area is selected and automatically generates an .mp4 file upon completion. Additionally, the built-in editor allows for trimming the video's length, cropping its resolution, and adjusting the volume.

## Features
- Easy to use GUI.
- Record or screenshot a custom area of the screen.
- Record speaker audio along with the video.

## Additional Information
- One minute of recording at 1080p resolution generates a file between 15-30 MB in size.
- All recordings are limited to 30 FPS.
- Application's demanding CPU usage could potentially result in laggy videos, particularly on systems with lower specifications. Performance tests (1 minute of 1080p recording):
  - Windows 10 64bit VMWare VM (4-cores): Averaged 10-11 FPS.
  - Windows 11 64bit PC (8-cores): Maintained stable 30 FPS.
